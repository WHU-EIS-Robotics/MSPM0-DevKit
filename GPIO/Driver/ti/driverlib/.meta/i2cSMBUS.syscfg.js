 * I2C speed configuration (Philips I2C specification
 * http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/UM10204.pdf):
 *    Standard-mode, Fast-mode (Fm), Fast-mode Plus (Fm+), and High-speed
 *    mode (Hs-mode) devices are downward-compatible - any device may be
 *    operated at a lower bus speed. Ultra Fast-mode devices are not
 *    compatible with previous versions since the bus is unidirectional.
 *        Bidirectional bus:
 *            o Standard-mode (Sm), with a bit rate up to 100 kbit/s
 *            o Fast-mode (Fm), with a bit rate up to 400 kbit/s
 *            o Fast-mode Plus (Fm+), with a bit rate up to 1 Mbit/s
 *            o High-speed mode (Hs-mode), with a bit rate up to 3.4 Mbit/s.
 *        Unidirectional bus:
 *            o Ultra Fast-mode (UFm), with a bit rate up to 5 Mbit/s
 *
 * Each device connected to the bus is software addressable by a unique
 * address and simple master/slave relationships exist at all times.
 *
 * A master is the device which initiates a data transfer on the bus and
 * generates the clock signals to permit that transfer. At that time,
 * any device addressed is considered a slave.
